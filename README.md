# Node React Chat Application

In this Repo, I have used React as frontend and Node Js in Backend.The application is perfectly separated by folders.

* Database that has been used is PostGreSQL.Which can be integrated in NodeJs with the help of sequelize.
* For Authetication JWT (Json Web Tokens) have been used instead of Passport.
* SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) replaced CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) in this project.
* Socket IO has been used.
